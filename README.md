# Decentralized News Aggregator

This project entails a FunctionsConsumer.sol smart contract that aggregates news and we will use a frontend to display it.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
